Code rules:
- We're using camelCase for naming, except for designated prefixes, such as p_ and h_ for "platform" (internal to the platform, such as its resolution) and "html" (part of the page, such as the resolution of the canvas)
- Please write code that is generic and reusable; we prefer a more functional style wherever it makes sense
- If you're not sure what to do with this information, ask someone in the club!
